        <h2>Code with Confidence</h2>
        <p>Using clear, humanized naming conventions, Basscss is quick to internalize and easy to reason about while speeding up development time with more scalable, more readable code.</p>
        <h2>No Side Effects</h2>
        <p>Things behave exactly as expected with immutable utilities and styles that follow the open/closed principle to help prevent common pitfalls with CSS.</p>
        <h2>Composable</h2>
        <p>Reusable, interoperable styles work like building blocks to lay the foundation for any stylesheet and can be mixed and matched in any number of combinations.</p>
        <h2>Designed for Design</h2>
        <p>Basscss strikes a balance between consistency and flexibility to allow for rapid prototyping and quick iterative changes when designing in the browser.</p>
        <h2>Responsive by Default</h2>
        <p>Basscss provides lightweight, performant styles and flexible utilities to design for any device and to help reduce boilerplate in stylesheets.</p>
        <h2>Unassuming</h2>
        <p>Modular and customizable base, typography, layout, and color styles donâ€™t dictate what things should look like and play well with other stylesheets and frameworks.</p>
